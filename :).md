### 💀 Hacker Personality Results

| Number | Personality Type |
|--------|------------------|
| **1**  | **The Recon Ghost** 👻  
Silently collects everything. Open ports, metadata, linked hosts — you don't miss a thing. OSINT is your weapon.
|--------|------------------|
| **2**  | **The Payload Artist** 🎯  
Crafts shellcode like poetry. You don’t use Metasploit — you *are* Metasploit.
|--------|------------------|
| **3**  | **The Social Wizard** 🕵️  
You hack humans more than machines. You know how to make people click — and how to trace the trail they left behind.
|--------|------------------|
| **4**  | **The Shell Samurai** 🐚  
Lives in the terminal. Vim, tmux, nmap, curl — the command line is your dojo.
|--------|------------------|
| **5**  | **The Bug Hunter** 🐞  
You chase bounties across the web. You're fast, methodical, and APIs are your playground.
|--------|------------------|
| **6**  | **The Architect** 🧱  
You break systems not just for fun — but to understand and rebuild them better. Infra, cloud, CI/CD — you wield them all.
